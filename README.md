## Introduction

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps businesses:
- Understand customer behaviors and preferences.
- Segment customers into meaningful groups.
- Optimize marketing strategies and product offerings.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Customer Personality Analysis** dataset from Kaggle. It contains customer demographic and purchasing data.

### Key Features:
- **Demographics**: Age, marital status, education, income, etc.
- **Purchasing Behavior**: Amount spent on different product categories.
- **Engagement**: Number of purchases through different channels (web, store, catalog).
- **Campaign Response**: Acceptance of marketing campaigns.

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the dataset structure.
   - Identify missing values and outliers.
   - Visualize data distributions and correlations.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Drop irrelevant columns.
   - Map categorical variables to numerical values.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features like `TotalAcceptedCmp` and `Children`.
   - Standardize numerical features for modeling.

4. **Unsupervised Modeling**:
   - Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.
   - Perform clustering using:
     - **KMeans**
     - **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
     - **Agglomerative Clustering**
   - Evaluate clustering performance using silhouette scores.

5. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Analyze clusters to identify distinct customer groups.
   - Generate actionable insights for marketing strategies.

## Key Findings

### Clustering Results:
- **KMeans** achieved the highest silhouette score (0.2489), indicating the best cluster separation.
- Identified 4 customer segments:
  1. **Moderate Earners with Higher Education Presence**
  2. **Lower Income, Without Higher Education**
  3. **High Income, Without Higher Education, Low Children**
  4. **Smallest Group, Low Income**

### Marketing Recommendations:

- **Group 1 & 3**: Offer value deals, discounts, and education-focused campaigns.
- **Group 0**: Use a mixed approach, highlighting variety and convenience.
